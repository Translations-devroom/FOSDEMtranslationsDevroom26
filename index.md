**[Schedule]([https://fosdem.org/2026/](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/translations/)**

**This devroom aims to showcase successful approaches in libre localization, community achievements, innovative workflows, tools, and integrations.**

**Come and share your experience with the localization process. Inspire others or propose solutions to struggles you spotted. It can be related to FOSS, open hardware, manuals, etc. 
Talk about what you find important; it can be your approach on used tools, community dynamic, workflows, benefits. Inspire others, leave inspired and carry new knowledge.**

## What

Talks describing collaborative efforts are the most welcome. Having a stack of good, well-integrated tools is just one part of the process. Don’t stop there. 
*   How do you motivate and care about your project’s community?
*   What did you learn when you introduced changes, improvements, and pursued milestones?
*   What inspired you to translate and improve the localization process and outcome for all developers, users, and translators?
