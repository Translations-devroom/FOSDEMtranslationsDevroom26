Your suggestions for improvements are welcome, create Issues on Github.

**CFP is open: we are waiting for your submissions.**

## Announcement

Come and share your experience with the localization process. It can be related to FOSS, open hardware, manuals, etc. Talk about what you find important; it can be your approach on used tools, community dynamic, workflows, benefits.

Talks describing collaborative efforts are the most welcome. Having a stack of good, well-integrated tools is just one part of the process. Don’t stop there. How do you motivate and care about your project’s community? What did you learn when you introduced changes, improvements, and pursued milestones? What inspired you to translate and improve the localization process and outcome for all developers, users, and translators?
